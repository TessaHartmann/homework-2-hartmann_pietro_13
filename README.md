Getting Started
===============

Project 2 Concat Primes
This program consists of tests and the physical program itself which can be repeated as many times as the user wants.


Installation and RUN

Download the .zip file from github repository, open a session in linprog then drop the file into the host computer's labeled repository for your session.  
Then, navigate into the file so when you type an ls command the internal files are shown.  
The program is already made so you can use the make test command to check if the tests pass, then use cd bin to navigate to the bin directory.  
There is a binary file called "concat" in this location.  
Once in the bin directory, use the command: concat to compile the program and run it.  Ctrl +C to stop the program.
